# Textfilling
Text-filling problem with different cost functions 
based on on example of the same name in the book
"Large Scale C++- Volume I" John Lakos, Addison Wesley
Boston 2020

The master branch is essentially the same as the source code in pages 65-67
except 
1. using stream iterator rather than the load function
2. using C++11 features such as auto ande lambda
3. the function parameters  for min_cost is 
  * vector<int> *result, // same as LSC - V1
  * start_index, // same as LSC - V1
  * fin_index, // one past the index as in STL iterators
  * connst Context&, // same as LSC V1

The mapped_version branch contains the program that is outline as Dynamic Programming
except
1. one long fixed length array in tag v1.2
2. vector of vectors that are all pre-allocated as soon as Context is constructed in tag v1.3
